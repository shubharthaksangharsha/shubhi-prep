Data transofrmation is a technique used to convert a raw data into suitable format that is efficiently easies data mining and retrieve stategic information 

1) Data smoothening: this method is used for removing the noise from the dataset. 
2) Noise is distorted and  meaningless data wihhtin a data and the noise is removed from the data using the technique such as bining, clustering, etc.
3) Data Aggregation: Aggregation is the process of collecting the data from a variety of sources and sorting it in a single format. Here, data is collected, stored, analysed and present in a report or summary format. 

4) Attribute Construction: in this method, new attributes are created from an existing set of attributes. 

5) Normalization: normalizing the data, referred to scaling the data values to a much smaller range such as -1 to 1 or 0.0 to 1.0.
There are different methods 
a) Min-Max normalization 
b) Z-score normalization
c) Decimal scaling 

a) Min-Max normalization: in this technique of data normalization, transofrmation is performed on the orginal data. Minimum and Maximum values from the data is fetched and each value is replaced according to the formula

v' =  (V - min(A) / max(A) - min(A) ) * new_max(A) - new_min(A) + new_min(A)
A = attribute  data 
Min(A) Max(A) = minimum and maximum value of A represent 
V' = new value of each entry in data 
V = old 


 new_max(A), new_min(A) - max A min value of range respectively

 exxample* we have $1200 and $9800 as the minimum  and maximum value for the attribute income and [00, 10] in the range in which we have to map a value $73600 
 n = 7360

>>> top = (n - min) * ((1.0  - 0.0) + 0.0)
>>> top / (max - min)
0.7162790697674418

 z-score nomralization: 
 in this technique, values are normalized based on mean and standard deviation, 

 v' = (v - mean(a)) / std(a)
 -> v' and v is the new and old of each entry in data respectively

 -> A & A' is the standard deviation and mean of A respectively 

 Example -> we have a mean and standard deviation for attribute A as 54000 and 16000 and we have to normalize  73600

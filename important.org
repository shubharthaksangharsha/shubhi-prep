** Array:
*** Definition : Contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-size elements indexed by contiguous integers.
*** Special : Constant Time Access to read and write.
**** Array_address + element size * ( i  - first_index) ( Compile do this for  us)
*** Multi-Dimensional Array : 
**** Row Major ordering/indexing : First take rows then columns of each row then next row 
**** Column major ordering : first column then second column 
*** Times for common operation : 
**** read element : O(1) 
**** write element : O(1)
**** add element at end of array : O(1)
**** Remove element at end of array : O(1)
**** Remove/ Insert at begining : O(n)
**** Remove/ Insert at middle : O(n) 
*** Great if add/remove at the end but expensive while removing/adding from middle/begining
